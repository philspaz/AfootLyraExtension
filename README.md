# Afoot Lyra FPS
 Added functionality to Lyra Starter Project for learning purposes

**Disclaimer** This is a work in progress, there's probably lots of bugs and it's not optimzed well. 

Put AfootLyraFPS folder in the plugins/gamefeatures folder of your project. When you open your lyra project, it should already be checked and working. 
If it doesn't, let me know what the problem is, maybe I can figure it out... 
Open up the map in the plugin and try it out. Press "X" to toggle first person.
